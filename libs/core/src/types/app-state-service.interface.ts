/**
 * Type definition for application state callback functions.
 *
 * This callback type is used throughout the application lifecycle management system
 * to define functions that execute during key application state transitions.
 *
 * The callback receives a NestJS application instance and can return:
 * - `void` for synchronous operations
 * - `Promise<void>` for asynchronous operations
 * - `Observable<void>` for reactive operations.
 *
 * @param app The NestJS application instance, fully configured and ready for use.
 *
 * @returns One of:
 * - `void` - For immediate synchronous execution
 * - `Promise<void>` - For asynchronous operations (async/await compatible)
 * - `Observable<void>` - For reactive programming patterns using RxJS.
 *
 * @example
 * ```TypeScript
 * // Synchronous callback
 * const syncCallback: IStateCallback = (app) => {
 *   console.log('Application ready');
 * };
 *
 * // Asynchronous callback with Promise
 * const asyncCallback: IStateCallback = async (app) => {
 *   await initializeDatabase();
 *   console.log('Database initialized');
 * };
 *
 * // Observable-based callback
 * const observableCallback: IStateCallback = (app) => {
 *   return from(setupHealthChecks()).pipe(
 *     tap(() => console.log('Health checks configured'))
 *   );
 * };
 *
 * // Usage with AppStateService
 * appStateService.onCreated(syncCallback);
 * appStateService.onListening(asyncCallback, -10); // High priority
 * ```

 * @see AppState - Application states during which callbacks execute
