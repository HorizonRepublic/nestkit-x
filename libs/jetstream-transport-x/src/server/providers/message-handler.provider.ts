/**
 * MessageHandlerProvider is the runtime layer that:
 * - subscribes on messages from JetStream
 * - finds the matching NestJS handler
 * - executes it under the correct delivery semantics
 * - resolves the message in JetStream via ack/nak/term
 * - (for RPC) publishes a response back to the caller.
 *
 * There are 2 delivery models in this transport:
 *
 * 1. RPC (Command channel)
 *    This is basically "I want a result", similar to HTTP via a broker.
 *    Flow:
 *    - The client publishes a command to a JetStream subject (not a direct request-reply call).
 *      The message includes:
 *        - ReplyTo header: where to publish the response
 *        - CorrelationId header: how the client will match the response
 *    - A service instance consumes the command from JetStream using a consumer (work queue style).
 *    - The handler runs.
 *    - The server publishes either a success response or an error response to ReplyTo,
 *      including the same CorrelationId.
 *
 *    After handler execution, we settle the original JetStream message in one
 *    of three ways:
 *
 *    - Success:
 *        1) handler produced a value
 *        2) we encode it and publish it to ReplyTo with CorrelationId
 *        3) msg.ack() - JetStream now considers this command processed.
 *
 *    - Handler error (business error, validation error, etc.):
 *        1) handler threw (not a TimeoutError)
 *        2) we encode that error and publish it to ReplyTo with CorrelationId
 *        3) msg.term() - we tell JetStream "this message is done, do not redeliver".
 *
 *      Why term() and not nak() here:
 *      - nak() would ask JetStream to redeliver the same command to another pod
 *      - that could re-run a non-idempotent business action ("charge card", "move inventory", etc.)
 *      - we explicitly do NOT want automatic retries for commands
 *      - instead we complete it with term() and let the client decide if it wants to retry.
 *
 *    - Timeout:
 *        1) handler didn't emit within the allowed window (e.g., 3 minutes)
 *        2) we do NOT publish anything to ReplyTo
 *        3) msg.term() with a timeout reason.
 *
 *      In this case the client will hit its own timeout as well and decide what to do next,
 *      exactly like a slow HTTP request where you never got a response.
 *
 *    Important difference from classic NATS request/reply:
 *    - We do NOT treat RPC as "send a request to an inbox and wait".
 *    - We treat RPC as "enqueue a command in JetStream (work queue semantics),
 *      then get the result asynchronously via a shared inbox channel."
 *    - The command itself is load-balanced and flow-controlled by JetStream
 *      (ack_wait, max_ack_pending, max_deliver, queue groups, etc.)
 *    - The reply uses the lightweight inbox.
 *
 *    This means:
 *    - you get horizontal scaling for command handlers
 *    - you get control over delivery guarantees
 *    - you keep request/response semantics for the caller
 *    - retries are explicit and owned by the caller, not by the broker.
 *
 *
 * 2. Event (Event channel)
 *    This is "fire-and-forget": something happened, other services may react.
 *    We are not trying to provide a response to the publisher.
 *
 *    Flow:
 *    - We receive an event message from JetStream.
 *    - We find the handler for that subject.
 *    - We start executing the handler.
 *    - As soon as the handler actually begins processing, we ack() the message.
 *
 *    The important nuance is WHEN we ack():
 *
 *    - We interpret "handler has started" as: the handler produces its first emission.
 *      Even if that's just `undefined`, we treat that first next() as a signal:
 *      "I accept responsibility for this event".
 *
 *    - Right after that first emission, we do msg.ack() and mark this event as handled
 *      from JetStream’s point of view.
 *
 *    - We do NOT wait for the entire business logic to finish. Long-running work
 *      (sending emails, updating projections, etc.) continues after we've acked.
 *
 *    Error handling logic for events:
 *
 *    - If the handler throws BEFORE it ever emits:
 *        -> we have not acked yet
 *        -> we msg.nak()
 *        -> JetStream is allowed to redeliver this event to another pod
 *        This means: "we failed to even start, maybe someone else can take it".
 *
 *    - If the handler throws AFTER we've already acked:
 *        -> we do NOT nak()
 *        -> we do NOT ask for redelivery
 *        -> it's now the handler's (business logic's) problem to compensate/retry.
 *
 *    This gives you "at-most-once after acceptance":
 *    - Either no one managed to start (we nak and someone else might retry)
 *    - Or one consumer said "I'm on it" (ack), and then it's that consumer's
 *      responsibility to finish or compensate.
 *
 *    Handler contract:
 *    - The handler is expected to emit at least once (even `void`) to signal
 *      "I have started".
 *    - If it never emits and also doesn't throw, we will never ack, so JetStream
 *      will eventually consider this unacked and redeliver based on ack_wait.
 *
 *    Where this model works well:
 *    - cache invalidation
 *    - projections / denormalized views
 *    - analytics / audit trails
 *    - notifications / fan-out.
 *
 *    Where this model is NOT appropriate:
 *    - critical state transitions (financial posting, order finalization, stock decrement, etc.)
 *      If you absolutely cannot afford to lose or duplicate the side effect,
 *      do not ship it as a "fire-and-forget event".
 *      Use RPC (so the caller gets an explicit result and can retry),
 *      or build a dedicated idempotent pipeline on top of raw NATS/JetStream.
 *
 *
 * Concurrency and backpressure:
 *
 * - We consume both commands$ (RPC) and events$ (Event) using mergeMap().
 * - mergeMap() here is intentionally unbounded, which means multiple messages
 *   can be processed in parallel.
 * - This favors throughput and low latency.
 * - If you need strict backpressure or a concurrency cap, wrap this layer
 *   and provide your own mergeMap(..., concurrency).
 *
 *
 * Delivery semantics summary:
 *
 * - RPC:
 *   success  -> publish response -> ack()
 *   handler error -> publish error -> term()
 *   timeout -> no response -> term()
 *   nak() is not used, because we do not want automatic replays of possibly
 *   non-idempotent business actions.
 *
 * - Event:
 *   handler starts -> ack() immediately
 *   handler fails before start -> nak()
 *   handler fails after ack    -> we do nothing transport-level,
 *                                 it's now up to the business code.

  /**
   * Handle an RPC-style command message.
   *
   * Steps:
   * 1. Find the handler for this subject.
   * - If no handler exists, we term() immediately because nobody can process it.
   *
   * 2. Validate required headers:
   * - ReplyTo: the subject where we should publish the response
   * - CorrelationId: allows the client to match the response with its original call.
   *
   * If either is missing:
   * - we term() the message (not nak)
   * - reason: redelivery won't help, it's already malformed.
   *
   * 3. Execute the handler:
   * The handler may return:
   * - T
   * - Promise<T>
   * - Observable<T>
   * - Promise<Observable<T>>.
   *
   * We normalize with from(...).switchMap(from(...)).take(1)
   * so we always deal with a single first value (RPC = single reply).
   *
   * 4. Timeout:
   * If the handler does not produce a value within 3 minutes:
   * - msg.term("timeout")
   * - we do NOT publish anything to ReplyTo
   * - the client should timeout on its side and decide on retry logic.
   *
   * 5. Error (non-timeout):
   * If the handler throws:
   * - we serialize that error
   * - we publish it to ReplyTo with the same CorrelationId
   * - we msg.term() to tell JetStream "this command is finished, don't redeliver".
   *
   * 6. Success:
   * If the handler returns a value:
   * - serialize and publish that value to ReplyTo with CorrelationId
   * - msg.ack() to mark the command as processed.
   *
   * Ack vs term in RPC:
   * - ack() means "successfully processed and responded"
   * - term() means "finished with failure/timeout; do not redeliver".
   *
   * Nak() is intentionally never used for RPC commands, because re-running
   * the same command on another pod can cause unsafe duplicate side effects.

  /**
   * Handle an Event-style message (fire-and-forget).

   * This model is optimized for fan-out / side effects, not for strict state transitions.
   * Examples:
   * - cache invalidation
   * - projection updates / denormalization
   * - analytics / audit trails
   * - notifications.
   *
   * It is NOT suited for critical once-only flows
   * like charging money, finalizing an order, etc. Those should use RPC
   * (so the caller gets an explicit response and can retry),
   * or a dedicated idempotent pipeline using raw JetStream/NATS.
   *
   * Core idea:
   * - We ack() as soon as we are sure the handler actually accepted the work.
   * We define "accepted the work" as: the handler emits its first value.
   * Even `undefined` is fine - it's just a signal of liveness/acceptance.
   *
   * - After we ack(), we consider the event consumed. JetStream will NOT
   * redeliver it to another consumer. At that point the handler "owns"
   * the long-running work.
   *
   * - If the handler fails BEFORE first emission, we nak() instead of ack().
   * That tells JetStream "try another pod, this one couldn't even start".
   *
   * - If the handler fails AFTER ack, we do nothing transport-level:
   * no nak(), no retry request. Cleanup/compensation is entirely
   * the handler's responsibility.
   *
   * Handler contract:
   * - The handler should emit at least once (even a void/undefined emission)
   * to indicate "I have started". We take(1) from that emission.
   * - If the handler never emits and also doesn't throw, we will never ack().
   * JetStream will eventually see ack_wait expire and may redeliver.
   *
   * Steps:
   * 1. Resolve handler. If no handler - term(), because retry won't help.
   * 2. Decode payload and build RpcContext (the same context object we reuse).
   * 3. Convert handler result into an Observable and take(1).
   * 4. On first next():
   * - ack() the message
   * - mark it as accepted, so no other pod will see it
   * 5. On error before ack:
   * - nak() so the broker may redeliver elsewhere
   * 6. On error after ack:
   * - swallow at transport level; it's now business logic's problem.
